    <h2 class="fontblack"> About us </h2>
    <p> The Bureau of CRINGE are tasked with locating, securing, and rehabilitating all cryptids, and incorporeal, extraterrestrial and extradimensional beings. These entities are self perpetuating individiuals who exists, wholly or in part, by means that we've determined are just weird. They constantly seek to simply live their lives and obtain peace on land that they don't pay taxes on. Several tests and investigations have proven inconclusive that they are able to comprehend the concept of taxation, however we have no reason to believe that they don't comprehend this concept. Our goal is to ensure the safety of the American People, and we will address any threat with the appropriate firepower.</p>
